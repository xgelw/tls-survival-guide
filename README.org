* Introduction

When a TLS connection is setup various checks are done by the TLS server as well as the TLS client.

This documentation shall help to diagnose TLS connection setup issues in a systematic way by verifying configurations on the server and client side.

Where appropriate, this documentation will show snippets how to use OpenSSL, nmap or network traces to identify configurations of either the server side or client. Please keep in mind that the main objective of TLS is to establish confidentiality and integrity. So at some point of time "looking at the wire" won't reveal anything anymore. This is even more true with TLS 1.3 where the handshake is also encrypted and even less information can be retrieved from the initial connection setup.
